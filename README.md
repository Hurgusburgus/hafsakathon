Hackathon Project: Recess

This project was developed by Oren Chikli, Smadar Danon, Guy Ginton, Gabriel (Gabe) Rimmon and Shay Weinstein for the 'Israel Tech Challenge Hackathon.' The <itc> Hackathon took place in Tel Aviv, Israel from January 2-3, 2019. 

Each team member played a role in every aspect of the project. Gabe and Guy focused on front end dev. Oren, Shay and Smadar focused on back end dev. Project management was implemented using Google Docs to discuss concepts, Google Sheets to create an agile enviornment and Googel Slides to present the conccept to judges. 

Recess was developed using React, Python, and mySQL served through DB4Free.net. The React code was built off of a template. 

This project is intended to serve only as a demo. It requires additional servers and functionality in order to be placed online or in app stores. 

Enjoy!
